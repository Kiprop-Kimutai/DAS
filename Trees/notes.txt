- A tree is a non-linear hierarchical data structure that consits of nodes connected by edges.
#Why Trees?
- Other data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues store data sequentially  since they are linear data structures.
- Performing operations in linear data structure leads to increased time complexity with increased input size. This is not a proper computational approach.
- Non-linear data structures allow operations on data from different points since they are non-linear. This quick access to data at points/nodes make them efficient
